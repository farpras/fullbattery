Ignore my actual battery status :p I trigger it just for test.

## Installation

Download the .exe here:
https://github.com/farpras/fullbattery/releases

Then put the .exe file on StartUp folder:
> C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

So it will start monitoring everytime your laptop boots. You may also click on it right away to start running the program immediately.

The program will check the battery status every 300 secs (5 mins) and it will trigger a notification when you plugged your charger and the battery exceeds 99%.

This program use <10MB of memory.
